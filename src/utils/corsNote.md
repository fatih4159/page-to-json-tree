# CORS Considerations

When fetching HTML content from external URLs, you may encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. Here are some options to handle this:

## For Development Testing

1. **Browser CORS Extensions**: Install a CORS-bypassing extension like "CORS Unblock" or "Allow CORS"

2. **Public CORS Proxies**: Use services like:
   - cors-anywhere: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
   - allorigins: https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=YOUR_URL

## For Production

1. **Set up your own proxy server**:
   - Create a simple server with Node.js/Express that fetches the URL and returns the content
   - Deploy as a serverless function (Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda)

2. **Use a headless browser service**:
   - Services like Puppeteer can be used in a serverless function to fetch and render pages

3. **Ask website owners for permission**:
   - Some websites might whitelist your domain if you ask

Remember that bypassing CORS for websites that don't allow it might violate their terms of service. Always respect website owners' intentions.
